# django-ezaddress

Django ezAddress provides an easy and extensible means of handling and 
incorporating address functionality for [Django](https://djangoproject.com) 
sites.

It is heavily inspired by [django-address](https://github.com/furious-luke/django-address).
This is a dulled-down version without the bells and whistles of google-map 
integration and some.
